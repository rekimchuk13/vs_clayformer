# Automatic Clay Former

Tired of the endless, tedious clicking required for clay forming? Do you wish you could just pick a recipe and have it magically appear? Now you can!

**Automatic Clay Former** is a simple but powerful client-side mod that completely automates the clay forming process. Say goodbye to repetitive strain and hello to effortless crafting. This mod handles all the voxel-by-voxel work for you, letting you sit back and watch your creation come to life.

### How It Works

Using the mod is as simple as playing the game. It seamlessly integrates with the existing clay forming mechanic.

1.  **Place Clay:** Start by placing a piece of clay on the ground, just as you normally would.
2.  **Select Recipe:** Pick the recipe you want to craft.
3.  **Let it Craft!** As soon as you select a recipe, the mod takes over. Make sure you have clay in your hotbar, and the engine will automatically start adding and removing voxels until the item is perfectly finished.

This is my very first mod for Vintage Story! I created it to solve a problem I personally had with the repetitive nature of clay forming and decided to share it with the community.
